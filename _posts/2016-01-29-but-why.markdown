Yup, first blog entry... Sooo, I will start with why. I am creating this blog for three reasons:

1. The possibility of being able to experience my own communication as others would experience it.
2. As a knowledge base for myself.
3. And as a way to relax and chill out a bit.

Now, sometimes, when I read code that I wrote 6 months to a year ago it is like reading code that someone else has written. I find this can afford me an interesting insight into my abilities (perceived or otherwise) and a unique opportunity for self analysis.

I want to try and replicate this opportunity with communication. Using these posts as a means.

In doing so, I want to try to resist writing long posts. Keeping it short and sweet, and try to convey only a single simple idea or design at a time.
